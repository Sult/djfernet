Maintained fork of github.com/yourlabs/djfernet/

`Fernet`_ symmetric encryption for Django model fields, using the
`cryptography`_ library.

``djfernet`` supports `Django`_ 4.0 and later on Python 3.

Only PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL are tested, but any Django database backend
with support for ``BinaryField`` should work.
